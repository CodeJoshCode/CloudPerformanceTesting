# CloudPerformanceTesting
Script to test the performance of a cloud instance. Testing IOPS, Disk Latency, memory and CPU performance.

Currently available for Debian based linux instances, tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Usage
1. After cloning the repo, get execute priveleges for the script. Command:
chmod 755 ubuntu_script.bash

2. Run the script and the results will appear in a file called total_test.txt.

That's all!
My next steps are getting output options such as csv, command parameters to tweak the tests, and writing/testing scripts for other Operating Systems.

Cheers,
Josh
