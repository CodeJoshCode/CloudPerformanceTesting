# CloudPerformanceTesting
Script to test the performance of a cloud instance. Testing IOPS, Disk Latency, memory and CPU performance.

Currently available for Debian based linux instances, tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

I am sending results to a NextCloud instance via WebDAV. I will make this optional asap, as well as making other changes for usability/flexibility/extensibility (in that order).

## Usage
1. Clone the repo. git clone https://github.com/CodeJoshCode/CloudPerformanceTesting.git

2. Make a file called credentials.txt with three lines:
USER=nextcloud-username
PWD=nextcloud-password
results_file_location_nextcloud=nextcloud-folder-location
TODO: examples

3. Run the script and the results will appear in a file labeled with the current date and time of when the test ran.

That's all!
My next steps are getting output options such as csv, command parameters to tweak the tests, and writing/testing scripts for other Operating Systems.
TODO: Make the timer output readable dates/times.

Cheers,
Josh
